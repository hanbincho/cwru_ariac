progress notes:  3/11/18
box advances OK, but need action server

grabs first flange OK
places it OK (though too much compression--tune this)
 box hover pose is not great; adjust this
 after releasing part, retraction is very SLOW

grabs second flange OK
problem with placement: did wrist flip, inappropriately
  wrist is "far", and it hits box

NEED: classify box part locations, (from camera view?)
 from robot view is:
flange in box is at height 0.448 w/rt world

per camera image:
"near" to robot is z = 0.1 (z>0)
"far" from robot is z = -0.2 (z<0)

"left" w/rt robot is y= -0.2 (y<0)
"right" w/rt robot is y = 0.2 (y>0)

wrist flip if destination has z>0 and y<0 per box camera

again:
grabs and places first gasket part OK (check on height)
2nd gasket part--did NOT do a wrist flip, and wrist interferes w/ box
  (maybe should do wrist flip AND move sled closer to box center)

failed to grab piston-rod part from near-right location;
  wrist interferes w/ bin edge
BUT retry on SAME  part (near-right) was successful!
  (was this a case of "dropped part"?)

placement in near-left corner w/ wrist flip is good...but lowers too far
  (deflects wrist during placement)

pick of piston-rod from front-left of bin was successful;
placement OK (but pressed too far down)
