make a new test node (same as assignment?) that does:

*listens for orders to come in
*finds parts in bins
*constructs "source" and "target" destinations
*sends these as goal to robot action server

repair:
*part error--> remove/replace part

TODO:
*make a fake robot action server
*already made  fake order publisher
*make a fake camera publisher (see example camera output recording)

*decide on design of Inventory (library):
  --should poll cameras, but avoid updates during robot operations that occlude camera and
     change part poses
  --should organize data by part IDs:
   input part ID, 
   get back:  
     a "source part" message populated w/ bin#, part name, current pose, 
     num parts avail, flipped/not-flipped
     sensor name responsible for observing that part
   option; ask for n'th part info
   option: ask for inventory update 
   option: ask for inventory update from n'th camera)

Q: how to get part info indexed by part name?  
   switch/case on part name string?
   make a fnc: part_ID(part_type_string)
   then switch (or index) on this part ID

   inventory struct:
     inventory.part_id.bin[]
     inventory.part_id.pose[]
     inventory.part_id.avail_bin[] //once a part  has been picked, note empty slot available
     inventory.part_id.avail_pose[]// along with pose coords
   inventory class/library:
     fnc: num_parts(part_id)
     fnc: get_part_info(part_id) //returns a single entry, without optimization
     fnc: get_part_info(part_id,i_part)
     fnc: get_sensor_source(part_id,i_part)
     fnc: update_inventory
     
----------progress 3/5/18---------
orderManager is able to: 
  *receive orders and sort them in vectors (high-priority, pending, unfillable)
  *update inventory
  *respond to requests for a copy of the current bin inventory
  *respond to requests for an order (choice to be optimized)
  *delete orders from vectors, on demand (current order deletion)
  *has fake fnc "fill_order(osrf_gear::Order order)"
    --this should go in a NEW class that fills orders and is responsible for:
     --filling robot goals and executing via the action server
     --responding to part quality sensors
     --responding to part location sensing
     --responding to sensed part drop

  create fnc: move_part(part_source,part_destination)
   special case if source and destination "location" codes are the same (fast move)
   define a "destination" for discarding bad parts


----place_part_fnc_no_release.cpp:
  computed poses (per compute_key_poses.cpp) look bad; FIX ME
  need 4 key poses for each of 4 cases (reach near left to far  right)
