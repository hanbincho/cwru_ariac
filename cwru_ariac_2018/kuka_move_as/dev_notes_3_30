status 3/31/18:

TransitionTrajectories defines a bunch of trajectories, stored in a 2-D map;

kuka_behavior_as: 
  gets command codes from action client within RobotBehaviorInterface
  responds by computing collision-free trajectories (and gripper controls)
  talks to Kuka trajectory action server to execute computed (or look-up) trajectories

RobotBehaviorInterface: intended  to simplify talking to  the robot behavior server;
 wraps action-client into function calls;
 all function calls ONLY require behavior name (i.e. function name) and Part descriptions.
 NO robot-specific info in RobotBehaviorInterface (robot agnostic).

robot_behavior_test_main.cpp: simple example "main" to illustrate use of RobotBehaviorInterface.


NEED TO:
*add more trajectories to TransitionTrajectories  (or make these on the fly w/ concatenation)
*add more functionality to behavior server
  place,  discard, compute pickup/dropoff  poses, control gripper (including moving into part until grasp)
*add corresponding fncs to behaviorInterface
