abb irb 140:

uses:
arm_motion_action
arm_motion_interface  (a library)
cartesian_motion_commander: contains example applications (uses of arm_motion_interface)
  example_generic_cart_move_ac4.cpp was created for irb140 testing

cwru_stickyfingers: library for  Gazebo plug-in for attach/detach in Gazebo

exmpl_models: can be convenient for spawning and manipulating models in Gazebo, e.g. toy_block

fk_ik_virtual: declares functions for fk and ik, in general, to be defined for specific robots
  (deferred); needed to generalize path planning

generic_cartesian_planner: libraries to perform Cartesian sampling, IK, and dynamic programming--> joint-space path
  defers specification of fk/ik library
  uses joint_space_planner library for dynamic programming

joint_space_planner: a library; computes optimal path through a (feedforward) graph
  generic with respect to number of dimensions, number of nodes per layer,
  and number of layers

irb140_path_cmd: package to illustrate how to  send trajectory commands to irb140;
  contains an interactive node that prompts for joint num and joint val, packages as a trajectory,
  and sends to robot (in a loop)

----------------
 arm_motion_interface, joint-space planner, generic cartesian planner,
  cartesian-motion commander: all robot agnostic
fk_ik_virtual

irb140_cart_move_as.cpp:  is robot-specific, presents action server called:
uses arm_motion_interface
